Established during the 2021 pandemic, pentaprism_ is a multi-cultural collective who investigate the conceptions and perceptions of artificial intelligence, and reimagines the visual language around AI in a mainstream context.

Inspired by the visual cultures of China, The United States, Poland and India, pentaprism_ challenges existing tropes of automation and scrutinises current representations of the human-tech relationship and the imaginings of its possible futures. We believe that current visuals around artificial intelligence and machine learning shape (mis)understandings of these technologies. Through research-led image-making and critical speculative design practice, pentaprism_ aims to draw attention to the encoded problems within AI to inform a more aware and hopefully more scrutinous audience.
